FUTURE STUFF:
    DONE: Add previous snapshots
	DONE: Add access to these previous snapshots
	Add good templates with tabs for live and snapshot modes
	Edit JS such that ports are used
        Can add port to json and print on tooltip
        Also could change fields in JS such that it is IP, SPORT, DPORT...
            Would need to change to d.IP instead of d.id and other such things
    Edit JS such that it is more zoomed in
	Edit JS such that more information can be gleaned from hovering/clicking on nodes
		IP
		Port
		Reverse DNS
		Application connecting to this?
	Edit JS so that we can move nodes better
	Maybe try to add notes that can be added to nodes (may be too much)
